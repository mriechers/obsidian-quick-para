This file provides Claude Code (claude.ai/code) specific guidance for working with the Quick PARA Plugin.

## Non-Claude Agents: Workspace Isolation Rules

**If you are NOT Claude Code** (e.g., Gemini CLI, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, or any other LLM agent), you MUST follow these isolation rules to avoid interfering with Claude agent work:

1. **Always work in a git worktree.** Never modify files on the current branch directly. Create a worktree before making any changes:
   ```bash
   git worktree add .worktrees/<your-agent-name>-<feature> -b <your-agent-name>/<feature-description>
   ```
2. **Always commit to a feature branch.** Your branch name must include your agent identifier (e.g., `gemini/fix-typo`, `codex/add-tests`, `copilot/refactor-utils`). Never commit to `main` or any branch you did not create.
3. **Never force-push, rebase, or modify branches you did not create.** Treat all existing branches as read-only references.
4. **Clean up after yourself.** When your work is complete, leave the worktree in place for human review. Do not merge your own branches.
5. **Follow all other rules in this file.** The conventions below (commit format, secrets management, attribution, etc.) apply to all agents equally.

> Claude Code agents are exempt from the worktree requirement because they are the primary agents for this workspace and coordinate directly with the user.


## Quick Start

```bash
# Build and test
npm run build

# Development with auto-rebuild
npm run dev
```

## Claude-Specific Notes

### MCP Servers Available

Claude Code has access to the following MCP servers that may be useful for this project:

**obsidian-vault** - Direct access to Obsidian vault files
- Can read/write vault notes for testing
- Useful for validating plugin behavior on actual vault content

**cli-agent** - Multi-LLM code review
- Query other models (Gemini, Codex) for code review
- Get alternative perspectives on architecture decisions
- Available as MCP tool or HTTP endpoint at `http://localhost:3001`

### TodoWrite Usage

Use the TodoWrite tool to track multi-step tasks:

**When to use:**
- Implementing new features with 3+ steps
- Complex refactoring across multiple modules
- Bug fixes requiring investigation + fix + testing

**When NOT to use:**
- Single-file edits
- Trivial changes (typo fixes, comment updates)
- Simple build/test operations

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Investigate bug in tagging.js - in_progress
2. Implement fix with null check - pending
3. Add test case for edge case - pending
4. Update CHANGELOG.md - pending
```

Mark tasks as `in_progress` when starting, `completed` when finished. Only one task should be `in_progress` at a time.

### Agent Attribution in Commits

Include agent name in commit messages for tracking:

```
feat: Add task preview mode

[Agent: Main Assistant]

Added dry-run functionality to show affected tasks
before cancellation. Helps users review changes safely.
```

See `/Users/mriechers/Developer/the-lodge/conventions/COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md` for complete format.

### Obsidian Plugin Testing

When making changes:
1. Build with `npm run build`
2. Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` to test vault
3. Reload Obsidian (Cmd+R) or toggle plugin off/on
4. Test feature in actual vault environment
5. Check Obsidian console (Cmd+Option+I) for errors

### Common Pitfalls

- **Forgetting to build**: Changes to `src/` files don't take effect until `npm run build`
- **Version mismatch**: Keep `manifest.json` and `package.json` versions in sync
- **Frontmatter corruption**: Always use `app.fileManager.processFrontMatter()`, never regex
- **Missing null checks**: Vault files may have unexpected structure, always validate
- **Breaking user data**: Use preview modes and confirmations for destructive operations
